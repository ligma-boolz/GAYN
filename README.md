vst3 plugin

Here is our very first vst3 plugin. Not only is making a gain plugin like the "HelloWorld" of vst programming, it's also the first stage of mixing(gain staging).
Getting your levels correct before starting a mix is essential to give you the headroom necessary to mix without levels clipping inside the DAW.

This is a free plugin, its in alpha stage and I have plans to add features like Hi/Low Pass Filtering, Stereo to mono downmixing, and eventually expanding it into a full featured track plugin. 

Enjoy.

TODO:

Save states as I forgot to implement it before rushing this out.
Automation.
